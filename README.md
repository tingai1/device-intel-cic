# DevSecOps MicroService Hub

## Introduction

DevOps is a culture that emphasize the collaboration and communication of all IT roles necessary to develop, deliver and support software and infrastructure through automation while eliminating silos and delays caused by organization boundaries. 

DevSecOps (a clipped compound of Development, Security, and Operations) is a software development methodology that combines the three fields to shorten the systems development life cycle while also delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business and security objectives, like DevOps but with security built in. The goal of DevSecOps is to create an environment where building, testing, and deploying software can occur rapidly, frequently, and securely.
